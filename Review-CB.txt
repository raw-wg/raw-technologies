Dear authors,

Please find below my review as part of my shepherding of the document. Huge apologies for the belated review.

Thanks,

Shepherd review of draft-ietf-raw-technologies-07



I find the document well written and quite detailed, probably too detailed sometimes. I think we should probably reduce the level of detail in some parts to what is really needed to understand the applicability of these technologies to DETNET/RAW. Some additional comments below.



Abstract:

“This document presents a series of recent technologies” —> I’d rewrite it to say that it identifies/describes a series of recent technologies and analyzes its applicability to deterministic flows, or something like that.



1. Introduction:

“every packet reach” —> “every packet reaches”

“network must highly” —> “network must be highly”

“On the one hand the network” —> “On the one hand, the network”

“time interval. .” —> “time interval.”

Expand P2MP

<Pascal>
all done, removed P2MP
</Pascal>


2. Terminology


“This specification” —> “This document”
<Pascal>
done
</Pascal>

“Deterministic Flow Identifier (L2) :” —> “Deterministic Flow Identifier (L2):”

Add reference regarding PCE.

“PREOF :” —> “PREOF:”
<Pascal>
Now refer to RAW Architecture
</Pascal>

Expand MUMIMO.
<Pascal>
done
</Pascal>

Check for consistency the definition of Track that has been discussed in the framework/architecture documents.


<Pascal>
done
</Pascal>

3.1 Scheduling for Reliability

“the Precision Time Protocol” —> “the Precision Time Protocol (PTP)”

<Pascal>
removed
</Pascal>

“A typical process control loop will tolerate an occasional

packet loss, but a loss of several packets in a row will cause an

emergency stop (e.g., after 4 packets lost, within a period of 1

second” —> Add reference supporting this.

<Pascal>
removed
</Pascal>


3.3  Benefits of Scheduling

Expand IOW

<Pascal>
removed
</Pascal>

“a nd” —> “and”


<Pascal>
done
</Pascal>


Section 4

I miss some text introducing the technologies that are going to be explained in Sections 4-7.



4.1  Provenance and Documents

“The main 802.11ax and 802.11be capabilities and their relevance to RAW are discussed in the remainder of this document.” —> it is not only those, also 802.11ad and 802.11ay. Besides, I think it should be explained why those from the previous list of amendments are described.



4.2.1 General Characteristics

Expand AP.



4.2.2 Applicability to deterministic flows

“in [Fang_2021].Nevertheless,” —> “in [Fang_2021].Nevertheless ,”



4.2.2.2. Scheduling for bounded latency and diversity

Expand MCS



4.4.1 General Characteristics

Remove space in “ .” at the end of each paragraph.



5.2.2.1.  Centralized Path Computation

Add caption to Figure 2.



5.2.2.2 6TiSCH Tracks

“oveall” —> “overall”



Overall, I find section 5 too long, especially comparing with section 4. I think it’d be useful to try to do an exercise of consistency across sections 4 to 7.



6.1.  Provenance and Documents

I’d remove the first sentence, as it does not really add much.

<Janos>
The goal with the sentence is to introduce 3GPP, which may be useful for some
readers. Otherwise it could be deleted, nonetheless, it may not hurt keeping it.
</Janos>


6.2. General Characteristics

I think we don’t need to go into that much details and at least I’d remove the last paragraph on authentication.

<Janos>
Well, I think each paragraph explains a different characteristics. 
In particular, the last paragraph is about security. I guess it is better to 
keep it as security is importatn. Each IETF documetn has a section dedicated to security.
</Janos>


6.4.1.  System Architecture

I know it is hard, but the text just mentions some of the core elements, while the figure 10 shows more. Maybe the text has to be a bit updated to mention this point.

<Janos>
Add:
"(Note that this document only explains key functions, however, Figure 10 provides a more detailed view.)"
</Janos>

6.4.5. Time-Sensitive Communications (TSC)

The 2nd and 3rd paragraphs explain concepts that are useful/needed to understand points made earlier in the document. Therefore, I think it might be worth moving that piece of text before each of the different technologies are deep dived into.

<Janos>
I'm not sure where to move.
The text is crafted in a way tp provide consice introduction to what comes later in 6.4.5, e.g., what TSN features are supported by 5G.
</Janos>

Shouldn’t the document mention something about ATSSS in the context of reliability and availability?

<Janos>
Well, we've got comments that too much details have been provided already. It seems better not to add more.
Furhtermore, ATSSS is not for time-critical traffic. It has no relations to URLLC, M-MTC, or I-IoT.  
In addidion, ATSSS is not a sole 5G technology, it is for a combination of 3GPP and non-3GPP access.
Moreover, ATSSS is not capabale for any kind of high-reliability provided by DetNet PREOF.
So, it seems better for me not to add ATSSS.
</Janos>


9. Security Considerations

I find the current text a bit insufficient. Either we: (ii) clearly state that this document is purely informational on some technologies that could be applicable to RAW, each of which have their own security mechanisms in place; or (ii) we provide much more details.



Sections 4 and 5 do not have a Summary subsection.
